# Secure-Coding-Project
My Secure Coding project is a Java application built with secure-by-design principles. It uses OOP and clear separation of responsibilities to manage data and operations, applies secure authentication, input validation, safe error handling, and configurable security rules, with logging for traceability and protection against misuse &amp; auditability.
